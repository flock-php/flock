# Installation

Download the installer for your platform from the [download page](https://flockphp.com/download). The Windows and macOS apps are code-signed, and the macOS app is notarized by Apple, so they open without security warnings. On Linux, Flock comes as a `.deb` or `.rpm` package from its own signed package repository.

## Windows

**Requirements:** Windows 10 (version 2004 or newer) or Windows 11, x64, and the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe), which PHP needs.

1. Run `Flock-Setup-<version>-x64.exe`. The installer itself doesn't need administrator rights.
2. The tray app opens with the first-run setup. Optionally keep **Open Flock when I sign in** checked.
3. Click **Set up Flock**. Windows asks for administrator approval once.

The setup:

- adds Flock's `bin` folder (with the `php`, `composer`, `node` and `npm` shims) to your PATH,
- registers the **Flock Daemon** scheduled task, which starts at sign-in without a console window,
- routes `*.test` to Flock's DNS server with a name-resolution policy rule, and installs a small helper service that keeps a `# BEGIN Flock` block in your hosts file as a fallback,
- adds Flock's certificate authority to the Trusted Root store.

## macOS

**Requirements:** macOS 15 Sequoia or newer, on Apple silicon (Intel Macs are not supported).

1. Open `Flock-<version>-macOS.dmg` and drag **Flock** to Applications.
2. Start Flock. A bird appears in your menu bar and the first-run setup opens.
3. Optionally keep **Open Flock's menu bar app at login** checked.
4. Click **Set Up Flock**. macOS asks for your password twice: once to add the DNS resolver, and once to trust Flock's certificate authority.

The setup adds the shims to your PATH, registers a launchd agent for the daemon, writes `/etc/resolver/test` so `.test` names go to Flock's DNS server, and trusts the certificate authority in your login keychain.

## Linux

**Requirements:** Ubuntu 24.04 or newer or a current Fedora release, on x64 or arm64, or Arch Linux on x64, with systemd-resolved as the system's DNS resolver (the default on Ubuntu and Fedora; on Arch, see below).

1. Install the package for your system. In the folder you downloaded it to, run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ./flockphp_<version>_amd64.deb     # Ubuntu
   sudo dnf install ./flockphp-<version>.x86_64.rpm    # Fedora
   ```

   On arm64, the files end in `_arm64.deb` and `.aarch64.rpm`. The package also adds Flock's package repository, so new versions of Flock come with your system's updates. **Beta versions** in **General**, or `flock channel beta`, switches it to Flock's betas.

   On Arch, Flock is the `flockphp-bin` package in the AUR. Install it with your AUR helper, and switch to systemd-resolved, which Arch doesn't use until you enable it:

   ```bash
   yay -S flockphp-bin                     # or: paru -S flockphp-bin
   sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-resolved
   sudo ln -sf ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
   ```

   New versions of Flock come with your AUR helper's updates (`yay -Syu`). Flock's betas are the package `flockphp-beta-bin`: installing it replaces `flockphp-bin` and keeps your setup, and installing `flockphp-bin` again goes back. **Beta versions** in **General**, or `flock channel beta`, also switches PHP and the services to their betas.
2. Open **Flock** from your apps. The Flock window opens with the first-run setup. Optionally keep **Open Flock when I log in** checked.
3. Click **Set Up Flock**. Linux asks for your password once.

To set Flock up from the terminal instead, run `flk install`. The package names the command `flk`, because `/usr/bin/flock` is a file-locking tool that every Linux system has. After the setup, `flock` works too: Flock's own `flock` comes first on your PATH and hands every command that isn't Flock's to the system's `flock`, so scripts that use it keep working.

The setup:

- adds Flock's `bin` folder to your PATH, in `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, fish's `conf.d` and `~/.config/environment.d` for apps started from the desktop,
- registers the `flock@<user>` systemd service, which starts with your computer,
- tells systemd-resolved to send `*.test` lookups to Flock's DNS server,
- adds Flock's certificate authority to the system's trust store, to Firefox through a policy, and to the certificate databases of Chrome and other Chromium browsers.

Flock also puts an icon in the top bar with its status, your sites, mail, dumps and logs. KDE shows it on its own, and GNOME with the AppIndicator extension, which Ubuntu includes. On Fedora's GNOME, install **AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support** to get it. Without the icon, Flock is a regular window that quits when you close it, and the daemon keeps running.

## Checking the installation

:::app
Click the bird in the menu bar (macOS) or the tray icon (Windows). The top of the panel should read **Running**, followed by the Flock version, and every service listed under **Services** should have a green dot. On Linux, open Flock: **Running** and the version are under the window's title, and **General** shows no warnings.

![The Flock panel with every service running](screenshot:panel-running)

Open a **new** terminal (so it picks up the new PATH). `php -v` and `node -v` should print Flock's versions.
:::

:::cli
Open a **new** terminal (so it picks up the new PATH) and run:

```bash
flock status
```

It shows the daemon, web server, DNS and every service, and whether `.test` names resolve. `php -v` and `node -v` should print Flock's versions.

## Ports

Flock needs ports **80** and **443** for the web server. If another program uses them, for example another local environment, IIS or Apache, Flock tells you which program it is. On Linux, it also gives you the command that stops it, such as `sudo systemctl disable --now apache2`.

:::app
Stop that program, then click **Restart** at the bottom of the Flock panel. On Linux, click **Restart Daemon** in **General**.
:::

:::cli
Stop that program and run `flock restart`.
