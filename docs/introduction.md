# Introduction

Flock is a free, open-source local development environment for Laravel on **Windows** and **macOS**. It installs and manages everything a Laravel app needs, and it runs natively on your machine, without Docker or a virtual machine.

## What Flock manages

- **Sites**: every project is served on a `.test` domain, optionally over HTTPS with a locally trusted certificate.
- **PHP**: versions 8.1 to 8.5 side by side (on Windows also 7.4 and 8.0), with the common extensions built in and Xdebug ready to switch on.
- **Node.js**: official builds from Node 16 up, chosen per project from `.nvmrc` or `.flockrc`.
- **Services**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Valkey, Redis, Meilisearch, Typesense and RustFS.
- **Tools**: a mail catcher, a `dump()` viewer, a Laravel log viewer and one-click Xdebug.

## How it works

Flock is a single `flock` binary that runs as a small background service (the *daemon*):

- An embedded [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) web server listens on ports 80 and 443 and passes PHP requests to PHP-FPM (macOS) or a pool of `php-cgi` workers (Windows). A site can also run on [FrankenPHP](php.md#frankenphp), with Laravel Octane's worker mode if you like.
- An embedded DNS server answers for `*.test`, so new sites work immediately without editing your hosts file.
- A local certificate authority issues HTTPS certificates. Its root is restricted to your local TLD, so it can't be used to impersonate real websites.
- Small **shims** for `php`, `composer`, `node`, `npm`, `npx` and the database clients sit on your PATH and run the version that the current project uses.

On top of that, a native app (a menu bar app on macOS, a tray app on Windows) gives you a UI for sites, versions, services, mail, dumps and logs. Almost every action is also available as a [CLI command](cli.md).

## App or CLI

You can drive Flock from the app, from the `flock` command, or mix the two: both talk to the same daemon, so a site you link in the terminal shows up in the app right away.

These docs show one way at a time. Use the **App | CLI** switch at the top of the sidebar, or the tabs above each set of steps, to choose. Your choice is remembered.

:::app
You're reading the **App** version: steps say where to click in the menu bar or tray panel and in the Settings window.
:::

:::cli
You're reading the **CLI** version: steps show the `flock` commands to run in a terminal.

## Not just Laravel

Flock serves `public/index.php` when a project has one, which covers Laravel, Symfony, Statamic, Craft and most other PHP frameworks. Otherwise it serves the project folder itself, which also covers plain PHP and static sites.

> Other languages and frameworks are on the roadmap.
